# Graph Coloring
* Optimal graph coloring is NP-complete
* By greedy coloring, upper bound is guaranteed. It never uses more than d+1 colors where d is the maximum degree of a vertex in the given graph
* 'K-colorable' graph: can be properly K colored
* 'K-Chromatic' graph: K is the optimal no. of colors required 
* Brooke's theorem: Any graph(which is not complete or which doesn't have odd cycles) is x chromatic, where x is the max degree of a vertex. For exceptions, it needs x+1 colors.
